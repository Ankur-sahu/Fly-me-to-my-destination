Algorithm

Step1.Initialize the three variable and that variable name is maxReach, fuel and plane.
step2.I Set the maxReach to the first element of the array, fuel to arr[0], and plane to 1.
step3.Then Iterate the array from the index 1  to the end, and updating the maxReac to the maximum index that can be reached from the current index using the fuel units specified by the value at the current index.
step4.If our fuel equal to the zero that means we have reached the end of the current fuel unit, then we update the fuel to maxReach and increment  in the plane.
step5.if i==n-1 means we have reched at the end then return plane
step6.if i >= maxReach we returns -1 we can not reach at the end
